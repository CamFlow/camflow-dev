/*!
 * @brief This function updates the version of a provenance node.
 *
 * Versioning is used to avoid cycles in a provenance graph.
 * Given a provenance node, unless a certain criteria are met, the node should be versioned to avoid cycles.
 * "old_prov" holds the older version of the node while "prov" is updated to the newer version.
 * "prov" and "old_prov" have the same information except the version number.
 * Once the node with a new version is created, a relation between the old and the new version should be estabilished.
 * The relation is either "RL_VERSION_TASK" or "RL_VERSION" depending on the type of the nodes (note that they should be of the same type).
 * If the nodes are of type AC_TASK, then the relation should be "RL_VERSION_TASK"; otherwise it is "RL_VERSION".
 * The new node is not recorded (therefore "recorded" flag is unset) until we record it in the "__write_relation" function.
 * The new node is not saved for persistance in this function. So we clear the saved bit inherited from the older version node.
 * The criteria that should be met to not to update the version are:
 * 1. If nodes are set to be compressed and do not have outgoing edges, or
 * 2. If the argument "type" is a relation whose destination node's version should not be updated becasue the "type" itself either is a VERSION type or a NAMED type.
 * @param type The type of the relation.
 * @param prov The pointer to the provenance node whose version may need to be updated.
 * @return 0 if no error occurred. Other error codes unknown.

 * Version should be updated every time an information flow occurs,

 * 1. The relation to be recorded here is to explicitly update a version, or
 * 2. Compression of nodes is used.
 * The criteria to be met so as not to record the relation are:
 * 1. Compression of edges are set. (Multiple edges should be compressed to 1 edge.), and
 * 2. The type of the edges being recorded are the same as before (we only compress same edges that occurs consecutively on the two nodes).
 * The relation is recorded by calling the "__write_relation" function.
 * @param type The type of the relation
 * @param from The pointer to the source provenance node
 * @param to The pointer to the destination provenance node
 * @param file Information related to LSM hooks.
